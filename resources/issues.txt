- When adding a new post bookmark from a topic page, if the user is asked to sign in, they should be redirected back to the topic page, not their bookmark list.
- The private topic list should display a list of topic participants beneath each topic so it's clear who has been invited
- Private topics should display a list of topic participants at the top of the topic
- Add edit notes to posts (or just an icon/link to post history if there have been edits)
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access a page that requires login, then abandons it, then goes to the sign in page and signs in, they're redirected to the initial page they requested. ctzn_referer needs to be cleared somehow.

- Topic move author notification doesn't work
- Topic lock notification at the top of the topic page needs to be styled
- "Subscribe to this discussion" links: either make them work or comment them out for now
