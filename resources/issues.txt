Issues

- User profile editing
- When posting an announcement, selecting only one forum throws an error because a single forum comes through as a string (controller expects an array)
- Link Markdown tutorial in textareas to Remarkable tutorial:
	https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/
- Bookmarks pattern
- When adding a new post bookmark from a topic page, if the user is asked to sign in, they should be redirected back to the topic page, not their bookmark list.
- The private topic list should display a list of topic participants beneath each topic so it's clear who has been invited
- Private topics should display a list of topic participants at the top of the topic
- Add edit notes to posts (or just an icon/link to post history if there have been edits)
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access a page that requires login, then abandons it, then goes to the sign in page and signs in, they're redirected to the initial page they requested. ctzn_referer needs to be cleared somehow.
- User profile styles
- Topic move author notification doesn't work
- Topic lock notification at the top of the topic page needs to be styled
- "Subscribe to this discussion" links: either make them work or comment them out for now
- "Notify me" link in private topics: make it work
- Announcements: if "Show it within the following forums" is selected, verify that at least one discussion is selected in the form validation.
