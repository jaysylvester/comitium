Issues

- Date handling and display (cache raw date, format on display)
- Terms of Service
- Password show/hide button on register and account pages
- Select input styles
- Error message styles
- Only show "First new post" link if there is a view time (might be better UX)
- User profile/preferences
	- Avatar
	- E-mail
	- Password
	- Signature
	- Regional settings (timezone, date format);
	- Theme
	- New private topic notification
- Hide topics/posts by ignored users
- Set cache lifespans
- Require password authentication to post/reply/etc., but add a setting to disable it
- Subscriptions manager (topics and discussions)
- Bookmarks pattern
- E-mail content and styles
	- Registration activation
	- Registration confirmation
	- Password reset
	- Private topic invitation
	- Topic subscription update
- Sticky topics
- Setting to enable/disable private topics
- Deleted announcements throw a 403 for administrators, but deleted topics are viewable
- When posting an announcement, selecting only one forum throws an error because a single forum comes through as a string (controller expects an array)
- Link Markdown tutorial in textareas to Remarkable tutorial:
	https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/
- When adding a new post bookmark from a topic page, if the user is asked to sign in, they should be redirected back to the topic page, not their bookmark list.
- The private topic list should display a list of topic participants beneath each topic so it's clear who has been invited
- Private topics should display a list of topic participants at the top of the topic
- Add edit notes to posts (or just an icon/link to post history if there have been edits)
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access a page that requires login, then abandons it, then goes to the sign in page and signs in, they're redirected to the initial page they requested. ctzn_referer needs to be cleared somehow.
- User profile styles
- Topic move author notification doesn't work
- Topic lock notification at the top of the topic page needs to be styled
- "Subscribe to this discussion" links: either make them work or comment them out for now
- "Notify me" link in private topics: make it work
- Announcements: if "Show it within the following forums" is selected, verify that at least one discussion is selected in the form validation.
- Styles for discussion template to show topics that have been updated since last visit
- Logic for discussions template to show discussions that have been updated since last visit
- When implementing inline editing and replying, gzip content so it can be passed via URL (https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate)
