Issues

- No real indicator that you're signed in. Need a welcome message or something.
- Posts are missing signatures
- Quick reply at the bottom of topic pages
- models > user.js > posts() - Currently pulls all public posts, even those from discussions the viewer doesn't have read access to (private, trash)
- Get rid of word wrap and whitespace wrap on buttons
- Topic edit
- Announcement edit
- Clear/update stats (topic, post, and user counts) on activity (activation, reply, delete, etc.)
- Log In / Sign Up buttons in header on mobile?
  - Replaced with new private topic indicator when authenticated
- Password reset confirmation and activation confirmation views: hide "Sign In" header and messaging beneath it
- Moderator and Administrator views
  - Views currently display all options based on user permissions. Create alternate views/modes for different groups so mods and admins can browse the forum without all the maintenance tools cluttering up the interface, but then switch to maintenance mode when necessary
- Expiration dates for announcements
  - Dumped to an archive forum that's still publicly accessible, but not visible from the main page
- Discussion breadcrumb link is broken on topic preview
- "Cancel and go back" button only works on initial page load. Using post preview resets the URL to the current page. Should turn this into a form variable so it posts with the form.
- Date and number display (cache raw, format on display)
  - Pass app.moment to view and format on the fly?
  - Format in the controller and update the cache?
- Emoticons
- Social / sharing
- Footer
- "New messages" indicator for private topics in top right corner
- Content pages
  - Terms of Service
  - Help
- Password show/hide button on register, account, and password reset pages
  - Remove password verification field from password reset page when this is done
- Select input styles
- Error message styles
- If a user is already subscribed to a topic, replace the "Notify me" checkbox on the reply form with a "You're subscribed to this topic" notice
  - Or pre-check the box and allow them to unsubscribe by unchecking it
- Only show "First new post" link if there is a view time (might be better UX)
- User profile/preferences
	- Avatar
	- Regional settings (date/time/number formats)
- Hide topics/posts by ignored users
- Navigation back to previous discussion page from topic pages
- Set cache lifespans
- Require password authentication to post/reply/etc., but add a setting to disable it
- Subscriptions manager (topics and discussions)
- Bookmarks manager
- Collapse quotes in posts to a few lines with a "view more..." link to reveal the entire quote
- E-mail content and styles
	- Registration activation
	- Registration confirmation
	- Password reset
	- Private topic invitation
	- Topic subscription update
- Sticky topics
- Topic/announcement/post "Save as draft"
- Invite users to an existing private topic
- Mark discussion as read
- "Notify me" / "Disable notifications" link on private topic list (based on existing privateTopicEmailNotification setting)
- Setting to enable/disable private topics
- Deleted announcements throw a 403 for administrators, but deleted topics are viewable
- When posting an announcement, selecting only one forum throws an error because a single forum comes through as a string (controller expects an array)
- Link Markdown tutorial in textareas to Remarkable tutorial: https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/
- When adding a new post bookmark from a topic page, if the user is asked to sign in, they should be redirected back to the topic page, not their bookmark list.
- The private topic list should display a list of topic participants beneath each topic so it's clear who has been invited
- The private topic reply form should contain the list of invitees so users are reminded of who will see their message
- Add edit notes to posts (or just an icon/link to post history if there have been edits)
- If an unauthenticated user tries to access a page that requires login, then abandons it, then goes to the sign in page and signs in, they're redirected to the initial page they requested. ctzn_referer needs to be cleared somehow.
- User profile styles
- Topic move author notification doesn't work
- Topic lock notification at the top of the topic page needs to be styled
- "Subscribe to this discussion"
- Announcements: if "Show it within the following forums" is selected, verify that at least one discussion is selected in the form validation.
- When implementing inline editing and replying, gzip content so it can be passed via URL (https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate)
- Visiting the base URL starts a new session because the existing cookies aren't valid for that path, rendering the user unauthenticated even after returning to the /forum path.
- Replace current page in pagination with select menu that allows direct access to individual pages
