  <h1>Terms of Service &mdash; TEH INNERNETS LLC</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
			This agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into by and between you ("you") and TEH Innernets, LLC (hereinafter referred to as "TEH Innernets") regarding your use of the TEH Innernets service (the "Service"). By using the Service, you are entering into this Agreement with TEH Innernets and indicating that you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions as originally stated, please do not use the Service. In addition, when using particular TEH Innernets owned or operated services, you and TEH Innernets shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new TEH Innernets properties, shall be subject to the Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
			1. Priority. This Agreement, in combination with TEH Innernets' Privacy Policy (available at www.originaltrilogy.com/privacy-policy.cfm), sets forth the terms and conditions under which TEH Innernets makes the Service available to you. In the event of an inconsistency between this Agreement and TEH Innernets' Privacy Policy, this Agreement shall control.
			</p>
			<p>
			2. Rights Associated with the Service. The Service is designed to help you find news information that resides on both TEH Innernets and on sites not owned or controlled by TEH Innernets. In particular, the Service provides brief descriptions of news stories to help you identify the stories of interest to you. When you select a story that appears to be interesting, you will be linked to either a TEH Innernets page that contains the full story or to the news site on which that story appears. TEH Innernets owns and retains all intellectual property rights to the Service; but TEH Innernets does not claim ownership rights to the full news stories, which are instead held by the sites to which the Service links or other third party providers.
			</p>
			<p>
			3. The news stories linked to by the Service are developed by people over whom TEH Innernets exercises no control. The results that appear from TEH Innernets' indices are indexed by TEH Innernets' automated machinery and computers, and TEH Innernets cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are gathered. As a result, the Service may display results and links to sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee that a TEH Innernets page will not include unintended or objectionable content. TEH Innernets assumes no responsibility or liability under any circumstances for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to by the Service.
			</p>
			<p>
			4. Registration. When you register on TEH Innernets, you must provide true, accurate and complete registration information. Should TEH Innernets suspect that your information is not accurate and complete, your account may be subject to suspension or termination. To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time TEH Innernets is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, you may not register to use TEH Innernets service.
			</p>
			<p>
			As part of the TEH Innernets Community User registration process, you will be asked to provide an email address, date of birth and to select a username and password. You, not TEH Innernets, will be responsible for all activities occurring under your username and for keeping your password secure. Please read TEH InnernetsÂ’' Privacy Policy (www.originaltrilogy.com/privacy-policy.cfm) for additional information as to TEH InnernetsÂ’' handling of your personal information. TEH Innernets retains the right to revoke and/or terminate any userÂ’s (including User EditorÂ’s) registration and all privileges associated with such registration at any time, including for any violation of this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
			5. Use of the Service. You may only display the content of the Service for your own personal use (i.e., non-commercial use) and may not otherwise copy, reproduce, alter, modify, create derivative works, or publicly display any content. For example, you may not do any of the following: use the Service to sell a product or service; use the Service to increase traffic to your Web site for commercial reasons, such as advertising sales; take the results from the Service and reformat and display them, or mirror any portion of the results on your Web site; or use the Service as part of a "meta-search" offering. You also agree that you will not use any robot, spider, other automated device, or manual process to monitor or copy any content from the Service. If you are uncertain whether your intended use of the Service is permissible, please contact us. In addition, TEH Innernets shall have the right in its sole discretion to suspend or terminate the Service or your access to it.
			</p>
			<p>
			6. Content. &quot;Content,&quot; as used herein, is all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted. Â“User ContentÂ” is any Content provided by and/or originating from a TEH Innernets user. &quot;Â“User Editor Content&quot; is any Content provided by and/or originating from a TEH Innernets User Editor, a user who properly registers on the User Editor Platform by providing all necessary information. As used herein, Â“ContentÂ” refers to both User Content and User Editor Content unless expressly stated otherwise. You understand that all Content is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not TEH Innernets, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. In this regard, you understand that TEH Innernets does not monitor or control the content of information posted by others, and instead simply provides a service by allowing users to access information that has been made available. Because TEH Innernets does not control the Content posted via the Service, TEH Innernets does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You acknowledge that by using the Service, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will TEH Innernets be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service. Should Content be found or reported in violation with, but not limited to, the following terms, it will be TEH InnernetsÂ’' sole discretion as to what action should be taken, including suspension and/or termination of your account.

			8. Content Submitted for Inclusion. TEH Innernets does not claim ownership of Content (including User Content) that you submit or make available for inclusion on the Service. However, with respect to Content (including User Content) that you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Service, you grant TEH Innernets a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive perpetual, irrevocable and fully sub-licensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed. The user and/or User Editor agrees never to sue TEH Innernets for use of said Content. Any copyright owner will cooperate with TEH Innernets to register such copyright should TEH Innernets need to enforce its licensed rights against others. "Publicly accessible" areas of the Service are those areas of the TEH Innernets network of properties that are intended by TEH Innernets to be available to the general public, including, without limitation, message boards, story submissions and/or all other areas of the site accessible by the general public.

			</p>
			<p>
			All users (including User Editors) of TEH Innernets certify and warrant that any Content he/she submits is his/her work and is not claimed by another. The user (including User Editor) agrees to insure that any work provided is correct, error free and does not contain any inflammatory language, indecency or obscenities.
